### Project Overview

 The objective is to predict the total cash deposits for all branches for the year 2016.


### Learnings from the project

 Not much cleaning in such a type of dataset. However, prediction was made simple by using the timestamp feature enabling us to calculate the age of funds right from the date of inception.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach was pretty simple and straightforward. It involved a little bit of cleaning by handling missing data, One-Hot Encoding, Decision Tree and finally XG Boost.


### Additional pointers

 By getting an idea of previous deposit patterns, we could predict an estimate for 2016 and verify the plans viability.
